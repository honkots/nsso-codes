 All India NSSO State and District Codes (PLFS 2017-18, EUS 68th, 61st &amp; 55th Rounds) - for those interested in creating district level pooled datasets of NSSO Rounds.

Most Indian datasets including Census and official labour-force surveys collect data at the district level. 
However, Indian districts are frequently split or merged with other districts for ease of administration. 
This makes it difficult to compare data from different years at the district-level.  

'IndiaStateDistrictCodes_NSSO.dta' is a STATA dataset that provides the NSSO state and district identity codes for each district up to the 55th NSSO EUS Round (1999-00). The aim is to map every district in the PLFS 2017-18 (651 districts in total) to its parent district in each of the thick NSSO Rounds - 68th, 61st and 55th.

The corresponding data files are available in ICSSR Catalogue (http://www.icssrdataservice.in/datarepository/index.php/catalog).
